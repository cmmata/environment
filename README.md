# environment
My personal development environment: fonts, config files, common libraries, etc. You are free to copy or modify anything you see in this repo if it's mine. If it's a third party stuff, take a look at it's license.

If you find something that you think it could be interesting for me, just open an issue and I'll thank you for the suggestion.
## fonts
Some great third party fonts I usually use.

## php
Coding standards or editor settings for PHP development.
